# Wheel of Time ... Thing

## IRIs

The ontology's IRI is `http://wot.barneyb.com/wot/` to leave space for an
application at the domain root, with dynamic content occupying the `/wot/` path.

IDs are generated by stripping punctuation, capitalizing every word, and then
stripping spaces. Thus, the ID for "Rand al'Thor" is `RandAlThor`. The ID for "
Asha'man" is `Ashaman` (no capital `m`).

Colloquial names should be used, for easier guessed-by-human. Thus, `TamAlThor`
and `MatCauthon` with `alternateIRI`s of `:TamlinAlThor` and `:MatrimCauthon`
respectively.

Titles should not be used, for example "Queen", "Sedai", or the royal "al'".
Thus, the ID for "al'Lan Mandragoran" is `LanMandragoran`,
not `AlLanMandragoran`. This may appear contradictory to Rand's ID above, but
the "al'" on Rand's surname, like many Emond's Field surnames, is not a title.
It was certainly derived from one: Aemon al Caar al Thorin, last King of
Manetheren, and Emond's Field's namesake.

Collisions are avoided by suffixing the local ID with some sub-namespace
separated by an underscore. Thus, the ID for the "Wolfbrother" chapter in _The
Eye of the World_ is `Wolfbrother_TEofW`. Both _The Great Hunt_ and _A Memory of
Light_ also have "Wolfbrother" chapters.

## Labels

Colloquial names should be annotated as `rdfs:label`, with a full name
via `foaf:name`. Thus, label `TamAlThor` as "Tam al'Thor", w/ name "Tamlin
al'Thor".
